          <h2>History</h2>
          <p><strong>Pearl Jam</strong> is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. The band's lineup consists of founding members Jeff Ament (<em>bass guitar</em>), Stone Gossard (<em>rhythm guitar</em>), Mike McCready (<em>lead guitar</em>), and Eddie Vedder (<em>lead vocals, guitar</em>), as well as Matt Cameron (<em>drums</em>), who joined in 1998. 
            Keyboardist Boom Gaspar has also been a touring/session member with the band since 2002. Drummers Jack Irons, Dave Krusen, Matt Chamberlain, and Dave Abbruzzese are former members of the band. 
            Pearl Jam outsold many of their contemporaries from the early 1990s, and are considered one of the most influential bands of the decade, being dubbed as "the most popular American rock & roll band of the '90s".<br /><br />Pearl Jam had sold more than <strong>85 million albums worldwide by 2018</strong>, including nearly 32 million albums in the United States by 2012, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. Pearl Jam was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017 in its first year of eligibility. 
            They were ranked at No. 8 in a reader poll by Rolling Stone magazine in its "Top Ten Live Acts of All Time" issue. Throughout its career, the band has also promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush's presidency. Vedder acts as the band's spokesman on these issues.</p>
